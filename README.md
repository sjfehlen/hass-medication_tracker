## 🗓️ Calendar Integration

The integration creates a calendar entity `calendar.medication_tracker_dose_taken` that displays dose history for all medications as calendar events.

**Features:**
- Each dose (taken or skipped) appears as a 5-minute event at the recorded time
- Event summary shows status and medication name (e.g., ✅ Taken: Aspirin (100mg))
- Event description includes medication details, status, time, notes, and frequency
- Viewable in the Home Assistant calendar interface for visual adherence tracking
- Calendar updates in real time as doses are recorded

**Example event details:**
```
Summary: ✅ Taken: Aspirin (100mg)
Description:
Medication: Aspirin
Dosage: 100mg
Status: Taken
Time: 9:15 AM
Notes: Taken with breakfast
Frequency: daily
```

**Use Cases:**
- Visualize dose history and adherence
- Filter by date, export data, or use in dashboards
- Automate notifications or reports based on calendar events
## 📢 Events

The integration fires a `medication_tracker_state_changed` event whenever a medication's status changes (e.g., from "not_due" to "due", or from "due" to "taken").

**Event Data:**
- `medication_id`: Unique identifier for the medication (now a UUID)
- `device_id`: Device identifier
- `name`, `dosage`, `frequency`, `notes`
- `old_status`, `new_status`
- `next_due`, `last_taken` (ISO datetimes)
- `missed_doses`, `adherence_rate`

**Status values:**
- `not_due`, `due`, `overdue`, `taken`, `skipped`

**Example automation:**
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Medication Due Notification"
    trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: medication_tracker_state_changed
        event_data:
          new_status: "due"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
        data:
          title: "Medication Due"
          message: "{{ trigger.event.data.name }} ({{ trigger.event.data.dosage }}) is now due"
          data:
            tag: "medication_{{ trigger.event.data.medication_id }}"
```

## 🌐 Web Management Panel

The integration includes a dedicated web panel accessible at `/medication_tracker` for easy medication management:

### Panel Features:
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically refreshes every 30 seconds and on entity state changes
- **Manual Refresh**: Click the refresh button for immediate updates
- **Add Medications**: User-friendly form with time pickers and date selection
- **Edit Medications**: Modify existing medications without removing and re-adding
- **Visual Status**: Color-coded medication cards showing current status
- **Take/Skip Actions**: Quick action buttons for each medication
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Accessing the Panel:
1. Add "Medication Tracker" to your sidebar via Settings → Dashboards → Add to sidebar
2. Navigate directly to `http://your-home-assistant:8123/medication_tracker`
3. Panel automatically persists after Home Assistant restarts

## 🔧 How Device-Based Organization Works

This integration implements a modern device-based approach:

1. **Adding Medications**: When you call `medication_tracker.add_medication`, a new device is created
2. **Device Contains All Entities**: Each medication device contains:
   - Status sensor
   - Adherence sensor
   - Due alert binary sensor
   - Take medication button
   - Skip medication button
3. **Organized Dashboard**: All entities for a medication are grouped under its device
4. **Easy Management**: Find medications easily in the device registry
5. **Clean Removal**: When removing a medication, the entire device and all entities are cleaned up

## 📅 Date Range Support

The integration supports optional start and end dates for medications:

- **Start Date**: Medication tracking begins on this date. Before the start date, the medication status will be "not due"
- **End Date**: Medication tracking ends on this date. After the end date, the medication status will be "not due"
- **No Dates**: If no dates are specified, the medication is active indefinitely

### Use Cases:
- **Antibiotics**: 7-day course with specific start and end dates
- **Seasonal medications**: Allergy medication during spring months
- **Trial periods**: New medications with planned review dates
- **Post-surgery**: Pain medication with defined duration

## Entities Created Per Medication Device

For each medication, a device is created containing:

### Sensors
- **Status Sensor**: Shows current medication status (due, taken, overdue, not_due, skipped)
- **Adherence Sensor**: Shows adherence percentage
- **ID Sensor**: Displays the medication's unique ID for service calls

### Binary Sensors
- **Due Alert**: Triggers when medication is due or overdue (excludes skipped medications)

### Buttons
- **Take Medication**: Mark medication as taken
- **Skip Medication**: Mark medication as skipped

## 🕒 Timezone Handling

The integration properly handles timezones for accurate medication scheduling:
- **Timezone-Aware**: All medication times are interpreted in your Home Assistant timezone
- **DST Support**: Automatically adjusts for daylight saving time changes
- **Consistent Timing**: Medications scheduled for 8:00 AM will always trigger at 8:00 AM local time
- **No UTC Confusion**: Times are never interpreted as UTC, preventing incorrect scheduling

### Add a medication via service call:
```yaml
service: medication_tracker.add_medication
data:
  name: "Vitamin D"
  dosage: "1000 IU"
  frequency: "daily"
  times: ["09:00"]
  start_date: "2025-08-01"  # Optional: start taking on this date

  medication_id: "med_1"
  dosage: "2000 IU"  # Increase dosage
  times: ["09:00", "21:00"]  # Add evening dose
  notes: "Take with breakfast and dinner"
```

### Find your medication ID:
After adding a medication, check the Home Assistant logs for a message like:
```
Added medication Vitamin D with ID med_1
```

### Create automation for medication reminders:
```yaml
automation:
  - id: medication_reminder
    alias: "Medication Reminder"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.vitamin_d_due
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Time to take your Vitamin D!"
          title: "Medication Reminder"
```

### Create automation for skipped medications:

      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.vitamin_d_status
        to: "skipped"
    action:
      - service: persistent_notification.create
        data:
          message: "Vitamin D was skipped. Consider taking it later if possible."
          title: "Medication Skipped"
```

### Device-based Lovelace card:
```yaml
type: entities
title: Vitamin D Medication
show_header_toggle: false

## 🔄 Data Consistency & Updates

The integration implements robust data consistency:
- **No Cached Values**: Status, due times, and last taken are calculated fresh from dose history
- **Real-time Updates**: Coordinator updates every minute for responsive status changes
- **Automatic Refresh**: Web panel refreshes every 30 seconds and on entity state changes
- **Timezone Accuracy**: All times properly handle DST and timezone changes
- **Data Integrity**: Storage only contains persistent data, calculated values are never cached


## Finding Medication IDs

Each medication now uses a UUID as its unique ID. To find the ID:

1. **ID Sensor**: Each medication has an ID sensor displaying the medication ID
2. **Check Home Assistant logs** after adding a medication
3. **Look at entity unique_ids** in Developer Tools > States
4. **Device names** in Settings > Devices & Services show the medication name

## Data Storage

The integration stores medication data in Home Assistant's storage system with proper data separation:

### Persistent Data (Stored):
- Medication details (name, dosage, frequency, times, dates, notes)
- Complete dose history with timestamps and actions (taken/skipped)
- Medication unique IDs and device associations

### Calculated Data (Not Stored):
- Current status (due, taken, overdue, not_due, skipped)
- Next due time
- Last taken time
- Adherence percentages

This separation ensures data consistency - status information is always calculated fresh from the actual dose history, preventing discrepancies between cached and actual data.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Medications showing wrong time:**
- Ensure your Home Assistant timezone is set correctly
- Check that medication times are in 24-hour format (e.g., "09:00", not "9:00 AM")

**Panel not loading:**
- Clear browser cache and refresh
- Check Home Assistant logs for JavaScript errors
- Ensure the integration is properly installed and loaded

**Status not updating:**
- Check coordinator logs for any errors
- Verify entities are being created correctly in Developer Tools → States
- Use the manual refresh button in the panel

**Binary sensor not triggering:**
- Verify the medication is currently due (not skipped, taken, or outside date range)
- Check automation triggers are using the correct entity IDs

### Debug Information:

Enable debug logging by adding to your `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.medication_tracker: debug
```
